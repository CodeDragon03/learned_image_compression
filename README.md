## **Project Title**

    Learned Image Compression Using Discretized Gaussian Mixture Likelihoods and Attention Modules

---

## **Description**

Implemented a deep **learning-based image** compression system using **discretized Gaussian Mixture Models** for precise entropy estimation and **attention modules** to improve visual quality. Achieves **state-of-the-art** compression performance with fewer bits and better image reconstruction, matching or outperforming standards like `JPEG`, `JPEG2000`, `HEVC`, and even `VVC` in `PSNR` and `MS-SSIM`.
